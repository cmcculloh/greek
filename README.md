# explore to learn

This is a little game I threw together in spare moments here and there in order to learn, and help my kids learn, Greek.

It is basically a "top-down" Minecraft inspired exploration game. As you move around the board, each time you move onto an "un-revealed" space, you are asked a semi-random question. If you answer it correctly, the space is "revealed" and you are able to move freely onto it from then on out. As you reveal spaces, you gather resources and gain levels (and the questions get harder).

`npm run start` to run.
